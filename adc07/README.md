# [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7): Camel Cards

A lot of ordering today.

I started by a rather long and unconvincing version in OCaml.

Then, I switched to Python where writing the solution was extremely straightforward, taking advantage of all the notational shortcuts and possibilities ([defaultdict](https://realpython.com/python-defaultdict/) for instance are really handy).

Finally, I switched back to OCaml, trying to translate the Python code as faithfully as possible. The code is a bit longer (defaultdicts are replaced by hashtbls with much heavier notations, I used references, etc.) but the result is more than OK.
