# [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4): Scratchcards

A nice and rather easy problem, with no parsing difficulties.

Of course, one should avoid recursion at all cost.

## Python

In `adc04.py`, we provide a not very efficient solution (in particular, the computation of the score has a very bad complexity, but here, we only have small entries).

In `adc04b.py`, we improve the efficiency of the computation of the score using sets. Moreover, the use of dictionnaries (and even _defaultdicts_ here), we can process everything with a single loop.

## OCaml

The first version resembles the first python version, with the use of arrays in the second part. In terms of complexity, it is not as efficient, as we sort the two lists of numbers (in O(n log n)) in order to compule efficiently their intersection (in O(n)).

A second version uses the different components defined in [Brucore](https://github.com/professeurb/brucore):

- dynamic arrays (_Ã  la Python_)
- hashsets
- generators

We obtain a very concise and efficient code (efficient... at least in terms of complexity, not in terms of actual speed as the data is too small).
