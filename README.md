# Advent of Code 2023

This repositery contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023.

It is organized into folders. Usually, solutions are provided in two langages, Python and OCaml.

For executing OCaml programs from the CLI, one should use [`dune`](https://github.com/ocaml/dune):

```shell
cd adc04 # day 4
dune build
dune exec adc04
```

Currently, additional libraries ([`angstrom`](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom) and [`brucore`](https://github.com/professeurb/brucore)) have to be installed manually.
